# Facial Recognition Authentication System

This project is a facial recognition authentication system designed to provide secure and convenient access control using facial biometrics. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and verify individuals based on their facial features.

## Features

- Facial detection: The system detects and identifies human faces in live video streams.
- Facial landmarks extraction: Key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and mouth are extracted for precise feature analysis.
- Facial encoding: Facial features are encoded into numerical representations for efficient comparison and recognition.
- Facial matching: The system compares the captured facial features with the stored facial templates to authenticate the user's identity.
- Authentication: The system determines whether the captured face matches an enrolled user's face and grants or denies access accordingly.
- User management: User registration, enrollment, and deletion functionality are provided to manage the system's user database.
